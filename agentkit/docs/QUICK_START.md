## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Node.js** | 18+ | `node --version` |
| **Git** | 2.30+ | `git --version` |
| **AI Tool** | Latest | See below |

You need at least one of these AI coding assistants:

- **Claude Code** -- Anthropic's CLI-based AI assistant (recommended for full feature support)
- **Cursor** -- AI-powered code editor
- **Windsurf** -- AI-powered development environment
- **GitHub Copilot** -- AI pair programmer in VS Code / JetBrains

AgentKit Forge generates configuration files for whichever tools your team uses. You do not need all of them -- pick the ones you work with.

---

## Setup in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Add AgentKit Forge as a Git Submodule

From the root of your project repository:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/your-org/agentkit-forge.git agentkit
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then install the runtime dependencies:

```bash
pnpm -C agentkit install
```

> **Note:** If you do not use pnpm, you can also run `npm install` inside the
> `agentkit/` directory, but pnpm is recommended.

### Step 2: Initialize for Your Repository

Run the `init` command with your repository name:

```bash
node agentkit/engines/node/src/cli.mjs init --repoName my-project
```

This command does three things:

1. Creates an overlay directory at `agentkit/overlays/my-project/` with your project-specific settings
2. Sets your repository name, default branch, and primary tech stack in `settings.yaml`
3. Prepares the configuration for your chosen AI tools

After initialization, review and customize `agentkit/overlays/my-project/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
repoName: my-project
defaultBranch: main
primaryStack: auto          # auto | node | dotnet | rust | python
windowsFirst: false
renderTargets:
  - claude                  # Remove any tools your team does not use
  - cursor
  - windsurf
  - copilot
  - ai
```

### Step 3: Generate Configs

Run the `sync` command to generate all AI tool configuration files:

```bash
node agentkit/engines/node/src/cli.mjs sync
```

This reads your overlay settings and the core spec, then renders configuration files for every tool listed in `renderTargets`.

Commit the agentkit directory (the generated outputs are gitignored):

```bash
git add agentkit/ .gitignore .gitattributes
git commit -m "feat: add AgentKit Forge configuration"
```

That is it. You are ready to go.

## What Just Happened?

The `sync` command generated several directories and files in your repository root. Here is what each one does:

### Generated Directories

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/` | **Claude Code configs** -- Slash commands, lifecycle hooks, specialized agents, coding rules, and orchestrator state. This is where the 23 commands like `/discover` and `/orchestrate` live. |
| `.cursor/` | **Cursor AI rules** -- Rules files in `.mdc` format that Cursor uses for context-aware code generation. |
| `.windsurf/` | **Windsurf AI rules and workflows** -- Rules and workflow definitions for Windsurf's AI assistant. |
| `.ai/` | **Portable rules** -- A tool-agnostic rules format compatible with Continue and other AI tools that support the `.ai/` convention. |
| `docs/` | **8-category documentation structure** -- A complete project documentation scaffold organized into product, specs, architecture, API, operations, engineering, integrations, and reference categories. |

### Generated Root Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | **Main AI instructions entry point** -- The first file Claude Code reads when it opens your project. Contains the project overview, command reference, workflow guide, safety rules, and links to all other configuration. |
| `UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md` | **Team specifications** -- Defines the 10 agent teams (Backend, Frontend, Data, Infrastructure, Auth, Integration, Documentation, DevEx, Platform, Quality), their responsibilities, scope patterns, and the 5-phase lifecycle model that governs all work. |
| `AGENT_BACKLOG.md` | **Work tracking** -- A prioritized backlog of tasks for AI agents to pick up, organized by team and priority. |
| `QUALITY_GATES.md` | **Definition of done** -- Quality gates for each of the 5 lifecycle phases, ensuring work meets standards before advancing. |

### Documentation Structure

The `docs/` directory follows a standardized 8-category layout:

```
docs/
  01_product/        Product requirements, user stories, roadmap, personas
  02_specs/          Functional spec, technical spec, API spec, data models
  03_architecture/   System overview, architecture decision records (ADRs)
  04_api/            API overview, endpoints, authentication, examples
  05_operations/     Deployment, monitoring, incident response, troubleshooting
  06_engineering/    Dev setup, coding standards, testing, git workflow, security
  07_integrations/   External APIs, webhooks, SDK documentation
  08_reference/      Glossary, FAQ, changelog, contributing guide, AI handoffs
```

This structure gives AI assistants a consistent place to read and write documentation, regardless of your project's domain.

## Your First Session with Claude Code

Open Claude Code in your project directory and walk through this sequence. Each step takes 1-3 minutes.

### 1. Discover Your Codebase

```
/discover
```

**What it does:** The Discovery Agent scans your entire repository and produces a codebase inventory. It detects programming languages, frameworks, build tools, package managers, CI/CD pipelines, test frameworks, code quality tools, and any broken or suspicious items.

**What you get:** An `AGENT_TEAMS.md` file in your repository root with a repository profile, team assignments tailored to your actual codebase, a folder map, and a list of detected issues.

**Example output:**

```
## Repository Profile
- Primary stack: TypeScript + React + Node.js
- Build system: pnpm + Turborepo
- Test framework: Vitest
- CI: GitHub Actions

## Team Assignments
### team-backend
- Focus: API routes, database, server-side logic
- Scope: src/api/**, src/server/**

### team-frontend
- Focus: UI components, pages, client-side state
- Scope: src/components/**, src/pages/**
...
```

### 2. Run a Health Check

```
/healthcheck
```

**What it does:** The Healthcheck Agent validates that your repository is in a buildable, testable state. It runs five checks in sequence: dependency installation, build, lint and typecheck, unit tests, and coverage reporting.

**What you get:** A structured report showing pass/fail status for each check, with an overall health verdict of HEALTHY, DEGRADED, or BROKEN.

**Example output:**

```
## Healthcheck Report

| Check        | Status | Duration | Details              |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Dependencies | PASS   | 4.2s     | pnpm install clean   |
| Build        | PASS   | 12.1s    | No errors            |
| Lint         | FAIL   | 3.8s     | 7 errors, 2 warnings |
| Typecheck    | PASS   | 5.4s     | No errors            |
| Tests        | PASS   | 8.3s     | 142 passed, 0 failed |

### Overall Status: DEGRADED
### Recommended Next Step: Run /check --fix to auto-fix lint issues
```

### 3. Plan Your Work

```
/plan Add user authentication with JWT tokens
```

**What it does:** The Planning Agent produces a detailed implementation plan without writing any code. It generates a goal statement, assumptions, numbered implementation steps, a file touch list, validation commands, a rollback plan, and identified risks.

**What you get:** A structured plan you can review and approve before any code is written. This prevents wasted effort on wrong approaches.

### 4. See Recommended Actions

```
/orchestrate --assess-only
```

**What it does:** The Orchestrator runs discovery and healthcheck, then reports the current project state and recommended actions without making any changes. Think of it as a project dashboard.

**What you get:** A summary of the current phase, active teams, backlog items, and suggested next steps.

### 5. Start Working

```
/orchestrate Add user authentication
```

**What it does:** The Orchestrator takes over as the master coordinator. It follows the 5-phase lifecycle: Discovery (understand the codebase) then Planning (design the solution) then Implementation (delegate to teams) then Validation (run quality gates) then Ship (document and hand off). State is persisted in `.claude/state/orchestrator.json` so you can resume later.

**What you get:** End-to-end implementation with quality checks at every step, a full audit trail in the events log, and a handoff document for the next session.

## Next Steps

Now that you have AgentKit Forge running, here is where to go next:

- **[COMMAND_REFERENCE.md](./COMMAND_REFERENCE.md)** -- Detailed documentation for every command, including all flags, arguments, and output formats.
- **[WORKFLOWS.md](./WORKFLOWS.md)** -- Worked examples of complete sessions: new feature development, bug fixes, project audits, and multi-session continuity.
- **[CUSTOMIZATION.md](./CUSTOMIZATION.md)** -- How to customize commands, rules, team definitions, and overlay settings for your project.
- **[ONBOARDING.md](./ONBOARDING.md)** -- The full onboarding guide with CI integration, pre-commit hooks, and troubleshooting.
- **[COST_TRACKING.md](./COST_TRACKING.md)** -- Token usage logging, session tracking, and monthly cost reports (roadmap).

### Tips for Getting the Most Out of AgentKit Forge

1. **Always start with `/discover`** when opening a project for the first time. It gives the AI a complete map of your codebase.
2. **Run `/healthcheck` before making changes.** If the build is already broken, you want to know before you start.
3. **Use `/plan` for anything non-trivial.** A 2-minute plan saves 20 minutes of wrong-direction implementation.
4. **End every session with `/handoff`.** The handoff document is what makes multi-session work possible.
5. **Let `/orchestrate` drive complex work.** It coordinates teams, manages state, and ensures quality gates are run at every step.
6. **Keep your overlay up to date.** As your project evolves, update `settings.yaml`, `commands.yaml`, and `rules.yaml` to reflect your current standards.
7. **Re-run `sync` after updating overlays.** Changes to overlay files only take effect after regenerating configs with `node agentkit/engines/node/src/cli.mjs sync`.
