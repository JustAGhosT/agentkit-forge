  - domain: typescript
    description: >
      Standards for all TypeScript and JavaScript code across the repository.
      Covers linting, formatting, type safety, and accessibility.
    applies-to:
      - "**/*.ts"
      - "**/*.tsx"
      - "**/*.js"
      - "**/*.jsx"
      - "**/*.mjs"
      - "**/*.mts"
    conventions:
      - id: ts-lint
        rule: "All code must pass ESLint with the project configuration"
        severity: error
        autofix: true
        tool: "eslint --fix"

      - id: ts-format
        rule: "All code must be formatted with Prettier"
        severity: error
        autofix: true
        tool: "prettier --write"

      - id: ts-explicit-types
        rule: >
          All exported functions, classes, and module boundaries must have
          explicit type annotations. Inferred types are acceptable only for
          local variables and private implementation details.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: ts-no-any
        rule: >
          Avoid 'any' type. Use 'unknown' with type guards when the type
          is truly dynamic. Exceptions require a comment explaining why.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

      - id: ts-wcag-aa
        rule: >
          All UI components must meet WCAG AA accessibility standards. This
          includes: semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where needed, keyboard
          navigation support, sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal
          text, 3:1 for large text), and screen reader compatibility.
        severity: error
        autofix: false
        applies-to:
          - "**/*.tsx"
          - "**/*.jsx"
          - "components/**"

      - id: ts-no-console
        rule: >
          No console.log in production code. Use the project's structured
          logger instead. console.log is acceptable in scripts/ and test files.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

      - id: ts-strict-null
        rule: >
          Strict null checks must be enabled. Handle null/undefined explicitly
          rather than relying on truthiness checks for non-boolean values.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

  # ===========================================================================
  # .NET / C#
  # ===========================================================================
  - domain: dotnet
    description: >
      Standards for all .NET and C# code. Emphasizes dependency injection,
      clean architecture layering, and API backwards compatibility.
    applies-to:
      - "**/*.cs"
      - "**/*.csproj"
      - "**/*.sln"
    conventions:
      - id: dn-dependency-injection
        rule: >
          All services must use constructor-based dependency injection.
          Service registration must be in dedicated extension methods
          (e.g., AddMyFeatureServices). Never use the service locator
          anti-pattern.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: dn-clean-layering
        rule: >
          Follow clean architecture layering: Domain has no external
          dependencies, Application depends only on Domain, Infrastructure
          implements interfaces defined in Application, and Presentation
          depends on Application. No layer may bypass the layer directly
          above it.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: dn-ports-adapters
        rule: >
          Use ports and adapters (hexagonal architecture) for all external
          integrations. Define port interfaces in the Application layer
          and implement adapters in the Infrastructure layer. This ensures
          external dependencies are always behind abstractions.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: dn-backwards-compat
        rule: >
          Public API surfaces must maintain backwards compatibility. Breaking
          changes require a version bump, deprecation notice in the prior
          version, and migration documentation. Use API versioning for
          HTTP endpoints.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: dn-format
        rule: "All code must pass 'dotnet format' with the project editorconfig"
        severity: error
        autofix: true
        tool: "dotnet format"

      - id: dn-nullable
        rule: >
          Nullable reference types must be enabled. All reference type
          parameters and return values must be explicitly nullable or
          non-nullable.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

  # ===========================================================================
  # Python
  # ===========================================================================
  - domain: python
    description: >
      Standards for all Python code. Covers linting, formatting, testing,
      and architectural boundaries for IO.
    applies-to:
      - "**/*.py"
      - "pyproject.toml"
    conventions:
      - id: py-lint
        rule: "All code must pass ruff check with the project configuration"
        severity: error
        autofix: true
        tool: "ruff check --fix"

      - id: py-format
        rule: "All code must be formatted with black"
        severity: error
        autofix: true
        tool: "black"

      - id: py-test-coverage
        rule: >
          All modules must have corresponding pytest test files. New code
          must include tests. Coverage must not decrease from the current
          baseline. Use pytest fixtures for test setup and parameterize
          for variant testing.
        severity: error
        autofix: false
        tool: "python -m pytest --cov"

      - id: py-io-boundaries
        rule: >
          IO operations (file system, network, database) must be isolated
          at module boundaries using dependency injection or explicit IO
          boundary patterns. Core logic must be pure and testable without
          mocking IO. Use protocols (typing.Protocol) to define IO interfaces.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: py-type-hints
        rule: >
          All public functions and methods must have type hints. Use
          typing.Protocol for structural subtyping. Run mypy in strict
          mode for new modules.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false
        tool: "mypy --strict"

      - id: py-docstrings
        rule: >
          All public modules, classes, and functions must have docstrings
          following Google style. Include Args, Returns, and Raises sections
          where applicable.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

  # ===========================================================================
  # Rust
  # ===========================================================================
  - domain: rust
    description: >
      Standards for all Rust code. Emphasizes explicit error handling,
      safety, and toolchain compliance.
    applies-to:
      - "**/*.rs"
      - "Cargo.toml"
    conventions:
      - id: rs-error-handling
        rule: >
          Use explicit error handling with Result and Option types. Define
          custom error types using thiserror for libraries and anyhow for
          applications. Chain errors with context using .context() or
          .with_context().
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: rs-no-unwrap
        rule: >
          Never use .unwrap() or .expect() in non-test code. Use proper
          error propagation with the ? operator instead. In tests,
          .unwrap() is acceptable for assertions. Panicking in production
          code is a bug.
        severity: error
        autofix: false
        exceptions:
          - "**/*.test.rs"
          - "**/tests/**"

      - id: rs-clippy
        rule: >
          All code must pass 'cargo clippy' with no warnings. Use
          #[allow(clippy::...)] only with an explanatory comment when
          a lint is genuinely inapplicable.
        severity: error
        autofix: false
        tool: "cargo clippy -- -D warnings"

      - id: rs-fmt
        rule: "All code must be formatted with 'cargo fmt'"
        severity: error
        autofix: true
        tool: "cargo fmt"

      - id: rs-unsafe
        rule: >
          Minimize use of unsafe blocks. Every unsafe block must have a
          SAFETY comment explaining why the invariants are upheld. Prefer
          safe abstractions. New unsafe code requires review by a second
          contributor.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: rs-documentation
        rule: >
          All public items must have documentation comments (///). Include
          examples in doc comments for complex APIs. Run 'cargo doc' with
          no warnings.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

  # ===========================================================================
  # Security
  # ===========================================================================
  - domain: security
    description: >
      Cross-cutting security rules that apply to all code in the repository.
      These rules take precedence over domain-specific rules when they conflict.
    applies-to:
      - "**/*"
    conventions:
      - id: sec-no-secrets
        rule: >
          Never read, print, log, or expose secrets, API keys, tokens,
          passwords, or connection strings in code, logs, or error messages.
          Use environment variables or secret managers. Never commit .env
          files, credentials, or private keys to version control.
        severity: critical
        autofix: false

      - id: sec-least-privilege
        rule: >
          Apply least privilege principle everywhere: IAM roles, database
          permissions, API scopes, file system access. Request only the
          minimum permissions required for the operation. Document why
          each permission is needed.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: sec-deny-by-default
        rule: >
          All access control must be deny-by-default. Authentication is
          required for all endpoints unless explicitly marked as public.
          Authorization checks must be performed at the handler level,
          not middleware alone. Default to most restrictive settings.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: sec-input-validation
        rule: >
          All external input must be validated and sanitized. Use schema
          validation libraries (zod, FluentValidation, pydantic, serde)
          at system boundaries. Never trust client-side validation alone.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: sec-dependency-audit
        rule: >
          Dependencies must be audited for known vulnerabilities before
          adoption and on a regular schedule. Pin dependency versions.
          Review transitive dependencies for supply chain risk.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

      - id: sec-encryption
        rule: >
          Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Use
          TLS 1.2+ for all network communication. Use AES-256 or
          equivalent for data at rest. Never implement custom cryptography.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

        rule: >
          Solana programs must use Anchor framework conventions. Validate
          all account constraints using Anchor macros. Use PDAs (Program
          Derived Addresses) for deterministic account addressing. All

        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: bc-etherlink
        rule: >
          EtherLink integrations must follow the bridge contract pattern.
          Validate all cross-chain messages. Implement replay protection.
          Use the canonical EtherLink SDK for L1-L2 communication.
          Handle finality differences between L1 and L2 explicitly.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: bc-x402
        rule: >
          x402 payment protocol implementations must follow the HTTP 402
          payment-required flow. Implement proper payment verification
          before granting resource access. Support idempotent payment
          processing. Include receipt generation and verification.
          Handle payment timeout and retry scenarios.
        severity: error
        autofix: false

      - id: bc-gas-optimization
        rule: >
          Optimize for gas costs. Minimize storage operations, batch
          transactions where possible, and use calldata over memory
          for read-only function parameters. Document gas cost estimates
          for public functions.
        severity: warning
        autofix: false

      - id: bc-audit-trail
        rule: >
          All state-changing operations must emit events for off-chain
