# GitHub Copilot Instructions

You are assisting with a project managed by the AgentKit Forge framework.
Follow these instructions for all code generation, suggestions, and chat responses.

## Core Workflow

This project uses a 5-phase orchestration lifecycle:

1. **Discovery** — Understand the codebase before making changes (`/discover`)
2. **Planning** — Define tasks with clear acceptance criteria (`/plan`)
3. **Implementation** — Write code in small, reversible increments
4. **Validation** — Run quality gates before marking work complete (`/check`)
5. **Ship** — Final review, merge, and deploy (`/review`)

Always start by reading `UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md` and `AGENT_TEAMS.md` to
understand team assignments, ownership boundaries, and escalation paths.

## Coding Conventions

- **Minimal diffs** — Change only what is necessary. Do not reformat unrelated
  code or reorganize imports unless that is the explicit task.
- **Backwards compatibility** — Avoid breaking existing public APIs. When a
  breaking change is unavoidable, document it clearly and provide a migration
  path.
- **Add tests** — Every behavioral change should include at least one test that
  would have failed before the change and passes after.
- **No secrets** — Never generate, log, or include API keys, tokens, passwords,
  or connection strings in code or comments. Use environment variables or secret
  managers exclusively.
- **Error handling** — Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures.
  Return meaningful error messages that help operators diagnose issues without
  leaking internal details.
- **Type safety** — Use the strongest type guarantees available in the language
  (TypeScript strict mode, Rust's type system, Python type hints with mypy).

## Repository Conventions

- `UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md` — Canonical team definitions and workflow phases
- `AGENT_TEAMS.md` — Repo-specific team mapping and ownership
- `AGENT_BACKLOG.md` — Current work items and priorities
- `docs/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), runbooks, and guides
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude-specific project context and conventions

When referencing documentation, always check these files first before making
assumptions about project structure or conventions.

## Working with Issues

- Read the full issue description and all comments before starting
- Link your changes to the relevant issue number in commit messages
- If the issue is ambiguous, list your assumptions in the PR description
- Break large issues into smaller, independently reviewable PRs

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from the default branch
2. Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages
3. Run the project's lint, test, and build commands before pushing
4. Open a PR with a clear summary, test plan, and checklist
5. Address review feedback in follow-up commits (do not force-push)

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task as complete, verify:

- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests cover the change
- [ ] Linter reports no new warnings
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in the diff
- [ ] Documentation is updated if behavior changed
