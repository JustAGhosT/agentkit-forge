# Git Workflow

## Overview

Git branching strategy and contribution workflow for **{{repoName}}**.

## Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Deploys To |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `main` | Production-ready code | Production |
| `develop` | Integration branch | Staging |
| `feature/*` | New features | — |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes | — |
| `release/*` | Release preparation | — |

## Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature develop
   ```

2. **Commit changes** following the commit message format below.

3. **Push and open a Pull Request** targeting `develop`.

4. **Code review** — At least one approval required.

5. **Merge** — Squash-merge into `develop`.

## Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:
