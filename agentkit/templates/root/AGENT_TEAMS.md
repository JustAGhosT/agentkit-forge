# Agent Teams — {{repoName}}

> Repo-local team mapping. Customize this file to reflect which teams are
> active in this repository, their actual directory scopes, tech stacks, and
> assigned lead agents.

## Overview

This document maps the canonical AgentKit team definitions (see
[UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md](./UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md)) to the concrete structure
of this repository. Not all teams may be active — mark inactive teams so the
orchestrator skips them during dispatch.

## How to Customize

### Activating a Team

1. Change the **Status** column from `Inactive` to `Active`.
2. Fill in the **Primary Scope** with actual directory paths in this repo.
3. Set the **Tech Stack** to reflect the tools and frameworks used.
4. Assign a **Lead Agent** identifier (used for mentions and escalation).
5. Add any relevant **Notes** about the team's role in this repo.

### Adding Custom Scope Patterns

Each team's scope patterns determine which files the orchestrator will assign
to that team. Use glob patterns:

```
src/server/**       — all files under src/server/
src/api/*.ts        — TypeScript files directly in src/api/
tests/unit/server/* — server unit tests
```

### Deactivating a Team

Set the **Status** to `Inactive`. The orchestrator will skip this team during
`/orchestrate` dispatch. Inactive teams:

- Do not receive task assignments.
- Are excluded from inter-team communication broadcasts.
- Can be reactivated at any time by changing status back to `Active`.

---

## Scope Overlap Resolution

When multiple teams have overlapping scope patterns, the orchestrator uses
these priority rules:

1. **Most specific pattern wins.** `src/auth/middleware/session.ts` matches
   T5 (Auth) over T1 (Backend) even though T1 covers `src/server/**`.
2. **Explicit assignment overrides.** A task explicitly assigned to a team
   via `--teams` flag takes precedence over pattern matching.
3. **Primary scope takes priority.** The team whose Primary Scope column
   lists the most specific matching directory owns the file.

### Common Overlap Scenarios

| File Path                        | T1 Backend | T5 Auth | Resolution        |
|----------------------------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `src/server/routes/auth.ts`      | Match     | Match   | T5 (auth routes)  |
| `src/server/routes/users.ts`     | Match     | —       | T1 (general API)  |
| `src/middleware/auth/guard.ts`   | —         | Match   | T5 (auth scope)   |
| `src/middleware/logging.ts`      | Match     | —       | T1 or T9          |

## Team Communication Channels

| Team           | Primary Channel               | Escalation Channel          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Backend (T1)   | `#team-backend`               | `#escalation-backend`       |
| Frontend (T2)  | `#team-frontend`              | `#escalation-frontend`      |
| Data (T3)      | `#team-data`                  | `#escalation-data`          |
| Infra (T4)     | `#team-infra`                 | `#escalation-infra`         |
| Auth (T5)      | `#team-auth`                  | `#escalation-security`      |
| Integration (T6)| `#team-integrations`         | `#escalation-integrations`  |
| Docs (T7)      | `#team-docs`                  | `#escalation-docs`          |
| DevEx (T8)     | `#team-devex`                 | `#escalation-devex`         |
| Platform (T9)  | `#team-platform`              | `#escalation-platform`      |
| Quality (T10)  | `#team-quality`               | `#escalation-quality`       |

## Review Cadence

- **Weekly**: Each active team reviews its backlog and updates task statuses.
- **Bi-weekly**: Cross-team sync to review dependencies and blockers.
- **Per-phase**: Quality gates are evaluated at each lifecycle phase transition.
