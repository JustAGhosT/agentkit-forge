## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for your stack (see `agentkit discover` output)
3. Run `agentkit sync` to generate AI tool configurations
4. Create a feature branch from `{{defaultBranch}}`

---

## Development Workflow

This project follows a 5-phase lifecycle model:

1. **Discovery** — Understand the problem, review existing docs
2. **Planning** — Design the solution, write ADRs for significant decisions
3. **Implementation** — Write code, add tests, run `/check` locally
4. **Validation** — Create PR, pass CI, get code review
5. **Ship** — Merge, update changelog, monitor deployment

See [UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md](./UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md) for full details.

## Commit Conventions

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`

**Examples**:
- `feat(api): add user registration endpoint`
- `fix(auth): handle expired token refresh`
- `docs(readme): update setup instructions`
- `chore(deps): update vitest to v2.1`

---

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `{{defaultBranch}}`
2. Run all quality gates locally: `agentkit validate`
3. Create a PR with a clear description and test plan
4. All CI checks must pass
5. Request review from the relevant team (see [UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md](./UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md))
6. Address review feedback
7. Squash-merge when approved

## AI Agent Contributions

When using AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.):

- Generated configuration files (marked `GENERATED by AgentKit Forge`) should
  not be edited directly — modify the spec and run `agentkit sync` instead
- Use `/orchestrate` for multi-team coordination tasks
- Use `/check` to validate changes before committing
- AI agents operate within the permission model defined in `.claude/settings.json`
- Hook scripts provide guardrails against destructive actions

---

## Code Standards

Code standards are defined per tech stack in `agentkit/spec/rules.yaml`.
Key conventions:

- Follow the linting and formatting rules for your language
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document public APIs
- Keep changes small and focused
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
