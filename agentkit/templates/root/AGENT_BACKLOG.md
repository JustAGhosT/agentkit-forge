## Backlog Management Rules

### Adding Items

1. Any team may add items to the **Backlog** section at any time.
2. New items must include all columns: Priority, Team, Task, Phase, Status, Notes.
3. Use the [Priority Definitions](#priority-definitions) below to assign priority.
4. Set the initial Phase based on how well-understood the task is.

### Promoting to Active Sprint

1. Items move from **Backlog** to **Active Sprint** during sprint planning.
2. The orchestrator (`/orchestrate`) may promote items automatically when
   dependencies are resolved.
3. Maximum active sprint size: **15 items** across all teams.
4. Each team should have no more than **3 active items** at a time.

### Moving to Completed

1. Items move to **Completed** only when they reach the **Ship** phase and all
   quality gates pass.
2. Record the sprint or date of completion in the **Completed** column.
3. Completed items are retained for **4 sprints** for reference, then archived.

### Handling Blocked Items

1. When a task is **Blocked**, add the blocker details in the **Notes** column.
2. Use the format: `Blocked by: T{n} - {description}`.
3. The orchestrator will attempt to resolve blockers during sync cycles.
4. If blocked for more than one phase cycle, escalate per UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md.

## Priority Definitions

| Priority | Label    | Definition                                                   | SLA          |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| P0       | Critical | Blocks all other work or affects production stability        | Same day     |
| P1       | High     | Required for current milestone; has downstream dependencies  | Within sprint|
| P2       | Medium   | Important but not blocking; can be deferred one sprint       | Next sprint  |
| P3       | Low      | Nice to have; backlog filler; exploratory                    | Best effort  |

---

## Status Definitions

| Status      | Description                                                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Todo        | Not yet started; waiting for sprint allocation or dependencies     |
| In Progress | Actively being worked on by the assigned team                      |
| Done        | Completed and passed quality gates for the current phase           |
| Blocked     | Cannot proceed; waiting on an external dependency or resolution    |

### Phase Progression

Tasks move through phases as defined in UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md:

```
Discovery -> Planning -> Implementation -> Validation -> Ship
```

A task's **Status** resets to **Todo** when it advances to a new **Phase**, unless
the team immediately begins work (then it moves to **In Progress**).

## Cross-Team Dependencies

Track inter-team dependencies here for visibility during orchestration.

| Upstream Team | Downstream Team | Dependency Description          | Status   |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|----------|
| T1-Backend    | T2-Frontend     | API contract for user endpoints | Pending  |
| T3-Data       | T1-Backend      | Database schema for user model  | Pending  |
| T5-Auth       | T1-Backend      | Auth middleware interface        | Pending  |
| T4-Infra      | T10-Quality     | CI pipeline for test execution  | Resolved |
| T8-DevEx      | All Teams       | Linting configuration           | Resolved |
