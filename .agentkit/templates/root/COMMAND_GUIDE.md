# Command Guide — When to Use Which

This guide helps you choose the right command for your situation. Most workflow commands read/write shared project state (`AGENT_BACKLOG.md`, `.claude/state/orchestrator.json`, `.claude/state/events.log`). Only `/orchestrate` acquires `.claude/state/orchestrator.lock`.

---

## Workflow Commands — Choosing the Right One

### `/orchestrate` — Full lifecycle coordination

**Use when:**

- You want the system to assess, plan, delegate, validate, and ship in one coordinated flow
- You're starting a new session and need a full assessment
- Work spans multiple teams and needs phased coordination
- You want state persisted across phases (Discovery → Planning → Implementation → Validation → Ship)

**Flags:** `--assess-only`, `--phase N`, `--team <name>`, `--dry-run`, `--status`, `--force-unlock`

**Shared assets:** Reads/writes `orchestrator.json`, `events.log`, `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`. Acquires `orchestrator.lock`.

---

### `/plan` — Structured implementation plan (no code)

**Use when:**

- You need a detailed plan before writing any code
- A backlog item involves more than 2 files or touches shared infra/APIs
- The team is uncertain about the best approach
- The orchestrator has requested a plan before Phase 3 (Implementation)

**Not for:** Quick one-file fixes, trivial config changes.

**Shared assets:** Reads `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`, `orchestrator.json`. Appends to `events.log`. Does not acquire the lock.

---

### `/project-review` — Comprehensive project audit

**Use when:**

- You want a production-grade review of the entire project
- You need systematic analysis of code quality, architecture, security, UX, performance, docs
- You're onboarding or doing a fresh assessment
- You want structured findings with a prioritized roadmap (waves)

**Not for:** Quick code review of a PR (use `/review`), incremental planning (use `/plan`), ongoing coordination (use `/orchestrate`).

**Flags:** `--scope`, `--focus`, `--phase`

**Shared assets:** Reads `orchestrator.json`, `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`. Writes findings to `events.log`. Does not acquire the lock.

---

### `/discover` — Codebase inventory (read-only)

**Use when:**

- You need to understand the repo structure, tech stacks, build tools, CI, tests
- You're starting fresh or the codebase has changed significantly
- You want `AGENT_TEAMS.md` updated with team boundaries

**Shared assets:** Appends to `events.log`. Creates/updates `AGENT_TEAMS.md`.

---

### `/doctor` — Setup and spec diagnostics

**Use when:**

- You need a quick health signal for AgentKit setup
- Sync/init behavior looks inconsistent and you need actionable checks
- You want malformed overlays/spec warnings surfaced before orchestration

**Flags:** `--verbose`

**Shared assets:** Reads spec and overlay files. Does not write orchestrator state or append to `events.log`.

---

### `/tasks` — View and process delegated task queue

**Use when:**

- You need to inspect task state (`submitted`, `working`, `completed`, etc.)
- You need one task's full detail (`--id`) before taking action
- You want dependency unblocking refreshed before status review
- You need to process completed-task handoffs (`--process-handoffs`), which mutates task state

**Flags:** `--status`, `--assignee`, `--type`, `--priority`, `--id`, `--process-handoffs`

**Shared assets:** Reads/writes `.claude/state/tasks/*.json` for dependency and handoff updates. When `--process-handoffs` creates tasks, append structured audit entries to `events.log`.

---

### `/delegate` — Create a team task

**Use when:**

- You need to assign scoped implementation/review/test work to a team
- You need explicit `dependsOn` or `handoffTo` routing
- You want auditable task artifacts/messages in the task protocol

**Flags:** `--to`, `--title`, `--description`, `--type`, `--priority`, `--depends-on`, `--handoff-to`, `--scope`

**Shared assets:** Writes `.claude/state/tasks/*.json` and appends structured `events.log` entries for task delegation auditability.

---

### `/healthcheck` — Build, test, lint validation

**Use when:**

- You want to verify the project builds, tests pass, and lint is clean
- You're about to start work and need a baseline
- You've made changes and want to confirm nothing is broken

**Shared assets:** Appends to `events.log`. Reads `orchestrator.json` for context.

---

### `/review` — Code review of changes

**Use when:**

- You're reviewing staged changes, a PR, or a commit range
- You want security, performance, correctness, and style checks
- You need a structured review before merging

**Not for:** Full project audit (use `/project-review`).

**Shared assets:** Reads `AGENT_BACKLOG.md` / `orchestrator.json` for context. Appends findings to `events.log`.

---

### `/handoff` — Session continuity summary

**Use when:**

- You are ending a session and need to hand over current status
- You want a concise summary of completed work, open risks, and next steps
- You need state continuity for another agent/person

**Shared assets:** Reads `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`, `orchestrator.json`, and recent `events.log` entries. Appends handoff event to `events.log`.

---

### `/sync-backlog` — Update AGENT_BACKLOG.md

**Use when:**

- You need to sync the backlog with GitHub Issues or project boards
- Discovery, healthcheck, or review has produced new findings to incorporate
- The orchestrator has completed a phase and backlog should reflect current state

**Shared assets:** Reads `orchestrator.json`, `events.log`. Writes `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`. Appends to `events.log`.

---

### `/scaffold` — Convention-aligned file scaffolding

**Use when:**

- You need a new module/component/feature skeleton that follows repo conventions
- You want path-safe generation under a specific target directory

**Flags:** `--type`, `--name`, `--stack`, `--path`

**Shared assets:** None by default (generates files in project paths).

---

### `/preflight` — Release-readiness gate

**Use when:**

- You need a focused release gate on a commit range or current diff
- You want strict failure behavior before merge/release

**Flags:** `--stack`, `--range`, `--base`, `--strict`

**Shared assets:** Reads repo state. Does not directly write shared state files unless explicitly wrapped by another workflow command that logs outcomes.
