## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainers or use the repository's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include steps to reproduce, impact assessment, and suggested fix if possible
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

---

## Security Conventions

These conventions are enforced by the `security` rule domain
(see `.agentkit/spec/rules.yaml`):

- **No hardcoded secrets** — API keys, tokens, passwords must never appear in source
- **Least privilege** — request minimum necessary permissions
- **Deny by default** — explicitly allow actions rather than deny
- **Input validation** — validate all external input at system boundaries
- **Dependency audit** — regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Encryption** — use TLS for transit, encrypt sensitive data at rest

## AI Agent Security

### Hook-based Protection

AgentKit Forge installs hook scripts that guard against common risks:

| Hook | Trigger | Protection |
|------|---------|------------|
| `protect-sensitive.sh` | Write/Edit operations | Blocks writes to `.env`, credentials, CI secrets |
| `guard-destructive-commands.sh` | Bash execution | Blocks `rm -rf /`, `git push --force`, etc. |
| `warn-uncommitted.sh` | Write/Edit operations | Warns when uncommitted changes accumulate |

### Deny-wins Permission Model

When base and overlay permissions conflict, deny always wins:

```yaml
# Base allows git push
permissions:
  allow: ["git push"]

# Overlay denies force push — this wins
permissions:
  deny: ["git push --force"]
```

### Template Sanitization

The sync engine sanitizes all template variable values, stripping shell
metacharacters (`` ` $ \ ; | & < > ! { } ( ) ``) to prevent injection
through overlay values.

## Permission Model

### Allowed Operations

See `.claude/settings.json` for the full list. Permissions are sourced from:

1. `.agentkit/spec/settings.yaml` — base permissions
2. `.agentkit/overlays/<repo>/settings.yaml` — repo-specific additions

### Denied Operations

Explicitly denied operations (these override any allow entries):

- `rm -rf /` and `rm -rf ~*` — catastrophic deletion
- `git push --force` and `git push -f` — history rewriting
- `git reset --hard` — working tree destruction
- `terraform destroy` — infrastructure destruction
- `az group delete` — Azure resource group deletion
- `gh repo delete` — repository deletion

---

## Secret Management

### Detection

The `validate` command scans for common secret patterns:

- AWS access keys (`AKIA...`)
- GitHub tokens (`ghp_...`)
- API keys (`sk-...`)
- Generic patterns (`password=`, `secret=`, `token=` in non-template files)

### Prevention

1. Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `credentials.*`)
2. Use environment variables or secret managers for runtime secrets
3. The `protect-sensitive.sh` hook blocks AI agents from writing to sensitive paths
