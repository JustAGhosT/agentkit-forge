# Webhooks

## Overview

<!-- Describe the webhook system for {{repoName}} — both inbound and outbound. -->

## Outbound Webhooks

### Event Types

| Event | Description | Payload Schema |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `resource.created` | Fired when a resource is created | See below |
| `resource.updated` | Fired when a resource is updated | See below |
| `resource.deleted` | Fired when a resource is deleted | See below |

### Payload Format

```json
{
  "event": "resource.created",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "type": "resource"
  }
}
```

### Delivery

- Webhooks are delivered via `POST` with a JSON body.
- A `X-Signature` header is included for payload verification.
- Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff (max 5 attempts).

### Signature Verification

```
HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, raw_body) == X-Signature header
```
