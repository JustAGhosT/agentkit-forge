# Warp Terminal

**Render target:** `warp`

---

## Platform Overview

Warp is an AI-native terminal and Agentic Development Environment (ADE) that
reads `WARP.md` or `AGENTS.md` for project rules and supports multi-agent
workflows, natural language commands, and integrated code review.

---

## Native Configuration

| Feature | Location | Format |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Project rules | `AGENTS.md` (preferred) or `WARP.md` | Plain Markdown |
| Subdirectory rules | `<subdir>/AGENTS.md` | Plain Markdown |
| Global rules | Warp settings UI | Warp config |

### Key Capabilities

- **Hierarchical rules**: Subdirectory rules override root, which override
  global. Most-specific context always wins.
- **Multi-agent support**: Run several AI agents concurrently, each for
  distinct roles (coding, review, DevOps, data analysis).
- **Natural language to command**: Describe a goal and the AI generates the
  command.
- **Contextual awareness**: Uses project rules, repo context, terminal history,
  and external systems via MCP protocol.
- **Agent autonomy levels**: Configure whether agents propose or execute
  automatically. Telemetry/logging controls available.
- **Warp Drive**: Syncs commands, environments, and shared agent prompts
  for team productivity.
- **Block-based output**: Every command/response is a selectable block,
  making sharing and collaboration easy.
- **Integrated editor & code review**: Tabbed file editor, code review diffs,
  multi-model AI support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
- **Workflows & templates**: Save and reuse multi-step command workflows.
- **Migration**: `WARP.md` is still recognized but `AGENTS.md` is recommended.
  File name must be uppercase for Warp to recognize.

### Directory Structure Example

```
project/
  AGENTS.md                # Project-wide rules (preferred)
  WARP.md                  # Legacy format (still recognized)
  api/AGENTS.md            # API-specific rules
  ui/AGENTS.md             # UI-specific rules
```

## What AgentKit Forge Generates

| Output | Path | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Root instructions | `WARP.md` | `templates/warp/WARP.md` + `project.yaml` |

## Gap Analysis

| Feature | Platform Supports | AgentKit Forge Status | Gap |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|-----|
| AGENTS.md (preferred) | ✅ Primary format | ✅ Always generated | None |
| WARP.md (legacy) | ✅ Backward compatible | ✅ Generated | Consider deprecating in favor of AGENTS.md |
| Subdirectory rules | ✅ Per-directory overrides | ❌ Not generated | Generate per-package rules in monorepos |
| Global rules | ✅ Via Warp settings UI | ❌ Not applicable | Platform-managed, not file-based |
| Multi-agent profiles | ✅ Concurrent agent roles | ❌ Not generated | Could generate agent role configs |
| Agent autonomy levels | ✅ Propose vs auto-execute | ❌ Not configured | Could document recommended settings |
| Warp Drive sync | ✅ Team command sharing | ❌ Not generated | Platform feature, not file-based |
| Workflow templates | ✅ Reusable multi-step | ❌ Not generated | Could generate common workflows |
| MCP integration | ✅ External tool connections | ❌ Not generated | Add MCP server config |

**Summary:** Warp is primarily served via `AGENTS.md` (always generated) and
the legacy `WARP.md`. Key gaps are subdirectory rules for monorepos and
generating multi-agent workflow templates.
