# Cursor IDE

**Render target:** `cursor`

---

## Platform Overview

Cursor IDE is an AI-native code editor that uses `.cursor/rules/` for persistent
project rules and `.cursor/commands/` for custom slash commands. Rules use the
`.mdc` format (Markdown with YAML frontmatter) and support context-aware activation.

---

## Native Configuration

| Feature | Location | Format |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Rules | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | MDC (YAML frontmatter + Markdown) |
| Commands | `.cursor/commands/*.md` | Plain Markdown |
| Legacy rules | `.cursorrules` (deprecated) | Plain text |

### Key Capabilities

- **Rich activation controls** in YAML frontmatter: `description`, `globs`,
  `alwaysApply`.
- **Auto context loading**: Rules are loaded into AI context for relevant
  files or scenarios based on glob patterns.
- **Manual and on-demand**: Reference rule names with `@rule-name` in chat.
- **Folder scoping**: `.cursor/rules/` can appear in subfolders for
  monorepo/microservice layouts.
- **Composability**: Split large policy sets into multiple modular rule files.
- **Commands (Cursor 1.6+)**: `.cursor/commands/*.md` for slash commands,
  analogous to Claude commands.

### Rule File Anatomy

Each rule file uses the `.mdc` extension with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: "Core TypeScript standards"
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---
# Actual rule content, guidelines, examples, etc.
```

### How Rules Are Triggered

- **Always Apply**: Loaded for all AI sessions if set (`alwaysApply: true`).
- **Auto Attach by Glob**: Loaded when working on files that match `globs`.
- **Manual**: Invoked via commands or by referencing with `@rule-name` in chat.
- **AI Decision**: The agent can decide to apply rules based on description relevance.

### Directory Structure Example

```
.cursor/
  rules/
    typescript-standards.mdc
    react-patterns.mdc
    api-guidelines.mdc
    frontend/
      components.mdc
  commands/
    build.md
    test.md
```

## What AgentKit Forge Generates

| Output | Path | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Project context rule | `.cursor/rules/project-context.mdc` | `templates/cursor/rules/` |
| Security rule | `.cursor/rules/security.mdc` | `templates/cursor/rules/` |
| Orchestrate rule | `.cursor/rules/orchestrate.mdc` | `templates/cursor/rules/` |
| Team rules (10) | `.cursor/rules/team-*.mdc` | `teams.yaml` |
| Commands (19) | `.cursor/commands/*.md` | `commands.yaml` (non-team commands) |

## Gap Analysis

| Feature | Platform Supports | AgentKit Forge Status | Gap |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|-----|
| Rules (.mdc) | ✅ Rich YAML frontmatter + Markdown | ✅ 13 rules generated | None |
| Commands | ✅ Slash commands (Cursor 1.6+) | ✅ 19 generated | None |
| Glob-based activation | ✅ In rule frontmatter | ✅ Used in generated rules | None |
| `alwaysApply` flag | ✅ For global rules | ✅ Used where appropriate | None |
| Subfolder rules | ✅ Monorepo support | ❌ Not generated | Generate per-package rules in monorepos |
| `@rule-name` references | ✅ Manual invocation | ⚠️ Not documented in output | Add usage docs to generated rules |
| Dynamic rule activation | ✅ AI-decided based on description | ✅ Descriptions included | None |
| Project/user/team hierarchy | ✅ User → project → team | ⚠️ Project only | Could document user-level rules setup |
| AGENTS.md support | ✅ Recognized | ✅ Always generated | None |
| Legacy `.cursorrules` | ⚠️ Deprecated | ❌ Not generated | Correct — deprecated format should not be generated |

**Summary:** Cursor IDE is well-supported. Primary gap is subfolder rules for
monorepo layouts. The `.mdc` format with YAML frontmatter is fully utilized.
