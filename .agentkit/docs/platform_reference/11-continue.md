## Platform Overview

Continue (continue.dev) is an open-source AI coding assistant for VS Code and
JetBrains. It uses `.continue/rules/` for project rules and supports a rich
ecosystem of shareable rule sets. Continue can render rules for multiple
target formats (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, Codex, Cody).

---

## Native Configuration

| Feature | Location | Format |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Project rules | `.continue/rules/*.md` | Markdown with optional YAML frontmatter |
| Hub/org rules | Continue Mission Control | Managed dashboard |
| Portable rules | `.continuerules` | Plain text |
| Cross-tool rules | `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules` | Auto-detected |

### Key Capabilities

- **Local rules** in `.continue/rules/` — version-controlled, project-specific.
- **Hub/organization rules** for cross-project enforcement via dashboard.
- **YAML frontmatter** for categorization: `title`, `objective`, `severity`,
  `applies` (glob patterns).
- **Severity levels**: `block` (hard enforcement) or `warn` (soft guidance).
- **Format conversion**: The rules CLI can render rules for Cursor, Claude,
  Copilot, Cody, Codex, and more.
- **Multi-model support**: Assign different rules to distinct models, tasks,
  or agents. Works with local and remote LLMs (Ollama, Azure, AWS).
- **UI + CLI**: Visual Studio Code extension GUI and `rules-cli` for
  downloading, rendering, and publishing rule sets.

### Directory Structure Example

```
.continue/
  rules/
    typescript-standards.md
    security-policy.md
    testing-requirements.md
  config.json
```

## What AgentKit Forge Generates

| Output | Path | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Continue rules | `.ai/continuerules` | `templates/ai/continuerules` |
| Cursor rules | `.ai/cursorrules` | `templates/ai/cursorrules` |
| Windsurf rules | `.ai/windsurfrules` | `templates/ai/windsurfrules` |

These are portable rule files that work across multiple IDEs.

## Gap Analysis

| Feature | Platform Supports | AgentKit Forge Status | Gap |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|-----|
| .continue/rules/ directory | ✅ Project-specific rules | ❌ Not generated | Generate rules in .continue/rules/ format |
| Portable rules files | ✅ Multi-format | ✅ 3 portable files generated | None |
| YAML frontmatter | ✅ title, objective, severity, applies | ❌ Not in portable files | Add frontmatter to generated rules |
| Severity levels | ✅ block / warn | ❌ Not used | Could classify rules by severity |
| Hub/org rules | ✅ Managed dashboard | ❌ Not applicable | Platform-managed feature |
| Format conversion | ✅ Multi-target rendering | N/A | Continue can render from any format |
| config.json | ✅ Model/provider config | ❌ Not generated | Could generate config.json |
| AGENTS.md support | ⚠️ Not directly | ✅ Always generated | Continue uses own rule system |

**Summary:** Continue is supported via portable rule files. Key gap is not
generating rules in the native `.continue/rules/` directory format with
YAML frontmatter. The portable format works but misses Continue-specific features.
