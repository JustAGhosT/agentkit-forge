### Edge Cases: When Two Teams Could Apply

| Scenario | Primary Team | Reason |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Auth-related API endpoint | `/team-security` | Security owns auth routes even though they are technically API endpoints |
| Database-heavy API endpoint | `/team-backend` | Backend owns the endpoint; coordinate with `/team-data` for schema work |
| Test for a frontend component | `/team-testing` | Testing owns test strategy; frontend may write the test if it is tightly coupled to a component change |
| CI pipeline for security scanning | `/team-devops` | DevOps owns pipelines; coordinate with `/team-security` for scan configuration |
| API documentation | `/team-docs` | Docs owns documentation; backend provides the technical content |

## Inter-Team Handoff Patterns

These are the three most common multi-team workflows. Each pattern shows the team sequence and what gets passed between them.

---

### Pattern 1: Backend Creates API, Frontend Consumes

This is the most common cross-team workflow for feature development.

```
/team-backend                     /team-frontend
     |                                  |
     |  1. Implement API endpoint       |
     |  2. Define request/response      |
     |     contract (types, schemas)    |
     |  3. Write API tests              |
     |                                  |
     +-- handoff: API contract -------> |
                                        |  4. Build UI component that
                                        |     calls the new endpoint
                                        |  5. Add client-side validation
                                        |  6. Write component tests
```

**What gets handed off:** The API contract (endpoint URL, request shape, response shape, error codes). Ideally defined as shared TypeScript types or an OpenAPI schema.

**Coordination point:** Both teams should agree on the API contract during `/plan` before either starts implementation.

---

### Pattern 2: Product Writes PRD, Backend + Frontend Implement, Testing Verifies

This is the standard feature lifecycle from requirements to verification.

```
/team-product                /team-backend + /team-frontend         /team-testing
     |                                  |                                |
     |  1. Write PRD with user          |                                |
     |     stories and acceptance       |                                |
     |     criteria                     |                                |
     |                                  |                                |
     +-- handoff: PRD + stories ------> |                                |
                                        |  2. Backend builds API         |
                                        |  3. Frontend builds UI         |
                                        |  4. Both write unit tests      |
                                        |                                |
                                        +-- handoff: feature branch ---> |
                                                                         |  5. Write integration tests
                                                                         |  6. Write E2E tests
                                                                         |  7. Verify acceptance criteria
                                                                         |  8. Report coverage gaps
```

**What gets handed off:**
- Product to Backend/Frontend: PRD document with user stories, acceptance criteria, and priority.
- Backend/Frontend to Testing: Feature branch with implementation and unit tests. Testing uses the acceptance criteria from the PRD to write verification tests.

**Coordination point:** The `/plan` phase should produce a shared implementation plan that all three teams reference.

### Pattern 3: Security Audit, Backend Fixes, Quality Verifies

This pattern is used for security hardening and vulnerability remediation.

```
/team-security               /team-backend                    /team-quality
     |                              |                               |
     |  1. Run security audit       |                               |
     |  2. Identify vulnerabilities |                               |
     |  3. Prioritize findings      |                               |
     |     (CRITICAL/HIGH/MED/LOW)  |                               |
     |                              |                               |
     +-- handoff: audit report ---> |                               |
                                    |  4. Fix CRITICAL and HIGH     |
                                    |     findings                  |
                                    |  5. Add tests for each fix    |
                                    |  6. Update security docs      |
                                    |                               |
                                    +-- handoff: fix branch ------> |
                                                                    |  7. Review fixes for
                                                                    |    correctness
                                                                    |  8. Verify no regressions
                                                                    |  9. Confirm all gates pass
                                                                    | 10. Approve for merge
```

**What gets handed off:**
- Security to Backend: Audit report with severity-classified findings, exact file/line references, and remediation guidance.
- Backend to Quality: Branch with fixes, tests, and documentation updates. Quality verifies the fixes are correct and complete.

**Coordination point:** Security findings should be added to `AGENT_BACKLOG.md` via `/sync-backlog` so they are tracked and prioritized alongside other work.

## Orchestrate vs Manual

When should you let `/orchestrate` handle team delegation automatically, and when should you invoke teams manually?

### Use `/orchestrate` When

| Scenario | Why Orchestrate |
|----------|-----------------|
| Multi-team feature development | Orchestrate manages the handoff sequence between teams and tracks state |
| You do not know which teams are needed | Orchestrate runs discovery first and identifies the right teams |
| Full lifecycle needed (discover through ship) | Orchestrate moves through all 5 phases automatically |
| Resuming a previous session | Orchestrate reads its state file and picks up where it left off |
| You want automated validation between steps | Orchestrate runs `/check` and `/review` between implementation and shipping |

**How it works:** `/orchestrate` reads the backlog, assigns items to teams based on their scope patterns, delegates work, runs validation after each team completes, and produces a consolidated summary. It manages the `.claude/state/orchestrator.json` state file and `.claude/state/events.log` to maintain continuity across sessions.

### Use Manual Team Invocation When

| Scenario | Why Manual |
|----------|-----------|
| Quick, single-team task | Overhead of full orchestration is unnecessary for a small fix |
| You know exactly which team should do the work | Skip the discovery and planning phases and go straight to implementation |
| You want fine-grained control over execution order | Invoke teams in the exact sequence you want |
| Debugging a specific team's output | Run just that team to reproduce and fix the issue |
| Parallel independent tasks | Invoke multiple teams in separate sessions for unrelated work |

**Example:** If you need to fix a single failing test, run `/team-testing` directly instead of spinning up the full orchestration loop.

### Hybrid Approach

You can combine both strategies:

1. Start with `/orchestrate --assess-only` to get a full picture of the project state.
2. Review the assessment and decide which teams need to act.
3. Invoke specific teams manually for focused work.
4. Finish with `/check` and `/review` to validate everything.
5. Run `/handoff --save` to record the session.

This gives you the intelligence-gathering benefits of orchestration with the precision of manual team invocation.

### Decision Flowchart

```
Is the task well-defined and limited to one team?
|
+-- YES --> Do you know which team?
|           |
|           +-- YES --> /team-<name>
|           +-- NO  --> /orchestrate --assess-only, then /team-<name>
|
+-- NO  --> Does it span multiple teams or phases?
            |
            +-- YES --> /orchestrate
            +-- NO  --> /plan first, then decide
```
