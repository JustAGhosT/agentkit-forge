# MCP Server and A2A Protocol Guide

This document explains the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configuration and
the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol templates shipped with AgentKit Forge.

## Overview

AgentKit Forge includes two template files under `.agentkit/templates/mcp/` that
configure how AI agents interact with external tools and with each other:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `servers.json` | MCP server definitions for tool-level capabilities |
| `a2a-config.json` | Agent-to-Agent protocol configuration for inter-agent communication |

Both files are rendered by the sync engine and written to the `mcp/` directory in
the project root during `agentkit sync`.

---

## MCP Server Configuration (`servers.json`)

The `servers.json` file declares MCP servers that AI agents can invoke as tools
during a session. Each entry maps a server name to a command and its arguments.

### Default Servers

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "git": { "command": "git", "args": [] },
    "puppeteer": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"] },
    "memory": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"] },
    "fetch": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch"] }
  }
}
```

**Server descriptions:**

- **git** -- Provides git operations as MCP tools. Invokes the `git` binary
  directly with no additional arguments.
- **puppeteer** -- Launches a headless browser via the
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer` package. Useful for screenshot
  capture, page interaction, and web scraping within agent workflows.
- **memory** -- Provides a persistent key-value memory store via
  `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`. Agents can store and retrieve context
  across tool invocations within a session.
- **fetch** -- Enables HTTP fetching via `@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch`.
  Agents can retrieve web content, APIs, and remote resources.

### Adding Custom MCP Servers

To add a new MCP server, add an entry to the `mcpServers` object in
`.agentkit/templates/mcp/servers.json` and run `agentkit sync`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "my-mcp-server-package"] }
  }
}
```

The `command` field is the executable to run, and `args` is an array of
arguments passed to `spawnSync`. The `-y` flag for `npx` auto-installs the
package if it is not already present.

## A2A Protocol Configuration (`a2a-config.json`)

The `a2a-config.json` file defines how agents communicate with each other using
the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol. This enables the orchestrator to delegate
tasks to team agents and aggregate their results.

### Protocol Settings

```json
{
  "a2a": {
    "enabled": true,
    "protocol_version": "1.0.0",
    "task_format": "json",
    "context_transfer": "memory",
    "result_aggregation": "orchestrator"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Whether A2A communication is active. Set to `false` to disable inter-agent messaging. |
| `protocol_version` | Version of the A2A protocol in use. |
| `task_format` | Serialization format for task payloads. Currently `"json"`. |
| `context_transfer` | How context is shared between agents. `"memory"` uses the MCP memory server. |
| `result_aggregation` | Which agent collects and merges results. `"orchestrator"` means the coordinator agent handles aggregation. |

### Agent Definitions

Each agent in the `agents` array declares its identity, role, domain, and
capabilities:

```json
{
  "id": "orchestrator",
  "role": "coordinator",
  "capabilities": ["delegate", "aggregate", "monitor"]
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "team-backend",
  "role": "executor",
  "domain": "api,services",
  "capabilities": ["implement", "test", "review"]
}
```

**Roles:**

- **coordinator** -- The orchestrator agent. Delegates tasks to executor agents,
  aggregates their results, and monitors overall progress. There is exactly one
  coordinator.
- **executor** -- A team agent that performs work within its domain. Receives
  tasks from the coordinator and reports results back.

**Registered agents:**

| Agent ID | Role | Domain | Capabilities |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| `orchestrator` | coordinator | (all) | delegate, aggregate, monitor |
| `team-backend` | executor | api, services | implement, test, review |
| `team-frontend` | executor | ui, components | implement, test, review |
| `team-data` | executor | database, models | implement, test, review |
| `team-infra` | executor | iac, cloud | implement, test, review |
| `team-devops` | executor | ci, cd, automation | implement, test, review |
| `team-testing` | executor | tests, quality | implement, test, review |
| `team-security` | executor | auth, compliance | implement, test, review |
| `team-docs` | executor | documentation | implement, review |
| `team-product` | executor | features, prd | implement, review |
| `team-quality` | executor | review, refactor | implement, test, review |

### Message Types

The A2A protocol supports four message types:

| Type | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `delegate` | coordinator to executor | Assign a task to a team agent |
| `report` | executor to coordinator | Return results from a completed task |
| `query` | any to any | Request information from another agent |
| `broadcast` | coordinator to all | Send information to all agents simultaneously |

## How MCP and A2A Work Together

The MCP servers provide tool-level capabilities (git operations, web fetching,
browser automation, persistent memory), while the A2A protocol provides the
communication layer between agents.

A typical workflow:

1. The orchestrator receives a high-level task via `/orchestrate`.
2. It sends `delegate` messages to the appropriate team agents via A2A.
3. Each team agent uses MCP servers (git, fetch, memory) as tools while
   executing its assigned work.
4. Team agents send `report` messages back to the orchestrator with their
   results.
5. The orchestrator aggregates results using the `result_aggregation` strategy
   and advances the workflow phase.

The `memory` MCP server is particularly important for A2A because it enables
`context_transfer: "memory"` -- agents can write shared context to the memory
store that other agents can read, enabling coordination without direct message
passing.

## File Locations

After running `agentkit sync`, the rendered files appear at:

```
<project-root>/
  mcp/
    servers.json        # MCP server configuration
    a2a-config.json     # A2A protocol configuration
```

The source templates live at:

```
.agentkit/
  templates/
    mcp/
      servers.json      # MCP server template
      a2a-config.json   # A2A protocol template
```
