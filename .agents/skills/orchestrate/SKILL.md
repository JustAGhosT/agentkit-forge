# orchestrate

Top-level orchestration command. Assesses the current repository state, identifies work to be done, delegates to appropriate team agents, and synthesizes results. The primary entry point for multi-step workflows.

## Usage

Invoke this skill when you need to perform the `orchestrate` operation.

## Instructions

1. Parse arguments and scan repo state (AGENT_BACKLOG.md, orchestrator.json, task queue).
2. Perform high-level design: draft strategy, constraints, success criteria.
3. Map sub-tasks to team agents; produce concrete task specs (inputs, expected outputs, validation rules) for each.
4. Delegate to appropriate team agents; track progress.
5. Collect and synthesize agent outputs into a unified result.
6. Run final validation/quality gates; iterate if needed.
7. Produce a clear report of decisions and outcomes.
