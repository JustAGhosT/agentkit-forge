# deploy

Triggers a deployment pipeline or generates deployment artifacts. Validates pre-deployment checks build, test, lint before proceeding. Supports dry-run mode for safety.

## Usage

Invoke this skill when you need to: release to production, validate staging, deploy hotfix rollouts, or generate deployment artifacts. Arguments: `environment` (production/staging), `version`/`tag`, `dry-run`, `force`. Prerequisites: CI green, artifacts built, credentials/config present.

Example: `deploy --environment staging --dry-run` or `deploy --environment production --tag v1.2.3`

## Instructions

1. Run pre-deployment validations: build, unit/integration tests, lint, artifact integrity (via CI or local `/check`).
2. Specify target: `environment` (staging/production), required credentials/flags.
3. Use dry-run mode to verify without deploying; confirm expected behavior.
4. Post-deploy: poll health endpoints, verify success criteria, apply timeout/retry policy.
5. On failure: run rollback procedure (revert to previous release, document steps).
