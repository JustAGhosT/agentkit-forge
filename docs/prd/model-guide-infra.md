## Weighting Profile

| Metric        | Weight | Rationale                              |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Code Quality  | 10%    | IaC quality and readability            |
| Reasoning     | 20%    | Architecture and reliability decisions |
| Cost          | 25%    | Cloud spend is a primary concern       |
| Context       | 20%    | Large infra configuration context      |
| Speed         | 15%    | Provisioning and release throughput    |
| Compatibility | 10%    | Multi-cloud and toolchain fit          |

## Scoring Contract

- Metric scale: `0-10` where `10` is best.
- Weight sum must equal `100`.
- Base formula:

`Weighted Score = (Code*10 + Reasoning*20 + Cost*25 + Context*20 + Speed*15 + Compatibility*10) / 100`

- Optional policy penalties:
  - `lock_in_penalty`: `0.00-0.20`
  - `quirks_penalty`: `0.00-0.15`
- Final score:

`Final Score = max(0, Weighted Score - lock_in_penalty - quirks_penalty)`

## Model Rankings (Final Scores)

### Tier 1: Recommended (Score >= 8.30)

| Model              | Score | Key Strengths                | Notes                         |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Claude Opus 4.6    | 8.55  | Strong reasoning and context | Best for complex IaC programs |
| GPT-5.3 Codex High | 8.35  | Strong code generation       | Premium option                |

### Tier 2: Strong Alternatives (Score 8.10-8.29)

| Model             | Score | Key Strengths                  | Notes                        |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro    | 8.20  | Large context and cost profile | Useful for large configs     |
| SWE-Llama         | 8.20  | Code specialization            | Good for template-heavy work |
| GLM-5             | 8.15  | Multilingual support           | Good for multi-region teams  |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 8.10  | Lower-cost Claude profile      | Routine infra updates        |

### Tier 3: Cost-Aware (Score 8.00-8.09)

| Model      | Score | Key Strengths              | Notes                       |
| ---------- | ----- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| o3         | 8.05  | Low cost and stable output | Cost-aware default fallback |
| Kimi K2.5  | 8.05  | Budget option              | Non-critical infra tasks    |
| xAI Grok-3 | 8.00  | Fast iteration             | Infra experimentation only  |

## Decision Policy

- Primary default: `Claude Opus 4.6`
- Cost-aware alternate: `o3`
- Large-context alternate: `Gemini 2.5 Pro`

Fallback triggers:

- Provider outage or repeated 5xx: route to next highest compatible model.
- 7-day spend overrun above 15%: route routine infra tasks to cost-aware model.
- P95 latency regression above 25%: switch to faster model in same score band.
- Deprecation notice: migrate in next release cycle with audit note.
