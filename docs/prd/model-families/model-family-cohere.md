## Operational notes

- Cohere has strong enterprise-oriented positioning for RAG and agent workflows.
- Independent benchmark measurements are needed before weighted ranking updates.

## Guidance for model guides

1. Add Cohere Command as intake for enterprise-RAG and compatibility analysis.
2. Keep scored tiers unchanged pending independent coding benchmark evidence.
3. Validate provider-specific behavior when deployed through Bedrock/SageMaker.

## Data gaps to close

- Independent coding benchmark scores for current Command releases.
- Cross-platform latency and cost normalization.
- Reliability and tool-call correctness in long agent sessions.
