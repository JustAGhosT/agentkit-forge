## Hugging Face Resources

| Resource      | Model ID                     | Notes                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Grok-1        | `xai-org/grok-1`             | 314B MoE model, open weights |
| Grok-1 Vision | `xai-org/grok-1-vision-beta` | Vision capabilities          |
| Grok-2        | `xai-org/grok-2`             | Latest Grok-2 release        |

> **Note:** xAI publishes Grok models via API (x.ai API) and has released open-weight versions on Hugging Face. The open-weight Grok-1 is notable as a 314B parameter MoE model.

## Operational notes

- xAI emphasizes end-user coding workflow speed and cost rather than only
  benchmark rank.
- The strongest numeric benchmark currently available in this pass is vendor
  reported, not independently verified.

## Guidance for model guides

1. Keep Grok as a candidate in speed/cost-aware tiers.
2. Require independent harness replication before top-tier promotion.
3. Monitor quality on complex multi-file refactors separately from bugfix tasks.

## Data gaps to close

- Independent SWE-bench and Aider benchmark replication.
- Provider-level reliability and timeout benchmarking.
- Comparative pass@2 and cost-per-success against GPT/Claude/Gemini.
