## TL;DR

The scorecard and recommender system gives teams practical model comparisons,
weighted decision logic, and configurable mappings so they can select the
right model per coding agent and continuously adapt as providers change.

## Problem Statement

LLM offerings evolve rapidly and vary widely in coding capability, pricing,
latency, and reliability. Teams struggle to maintain optimal mappings over
time. Suboptimal choices reduce velocity and increase spend.

## Core Challenge

Map each agent type and team context to the best model while balancing:

- code quality,
- reasoning quality,
- context capacity,
- latency,
- cost,
- vendor and integration risk.

## Current State

- Teams rely on defaults or outdated benchmarks.
- Model switching is manual and weakly documented.
- Scorecard data is often fragmented across tools.
- Reliability and quality vary between repos and teams.

## Why Now

Major model families are updated frequently. Teams need stable governance and
faster adaptation loops to stay competitive on delivery speed and cost.

## Goals and Objectives

### Business Goals

- Make Forge the leading mesh-native platform for coding-agent orchestration.
- Reduce customer model-operation cost by 20% in 12 months.
- Increase enterprise adoption through transparent model comparisons.

### User Goals

- Understand practical model trade-offs for coding use cases.
- Reassign agents to better models with low effort.
- Improve predictability in agent-driven pipelines.

### Non-Goals

- Non-coding LLM recommendation coverage in v1.
- Full support for private non-API models.
- Fine-tuned model recommendation outside supported families.

## Measurable Objectives

| Metric                   | Baseline | Target | Timeline |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| Agent latency reduction  | N/A      | -20%   | 3 months |
| Code acceptance rate     | 65%      | 80%    | 6 months |
| Model reassignment usage | <10%     | >70%   | 6 months |
| API cost per build       | $0.13    | <$0.10 | 6 months |

## User Personas and Stories

### ML Infra Engineer

Needs reliable recommendations and fast update cycles to optimize performance
and cost.

User story:

As an ML infra engineer, I want a dynamic scorecard so I can compare models
quickly for my coding workflows.

### Developer Team Lead

Needs to improve velocity and quality without manual model testing overhead.

User story:

As a team lead, I want to map bug-fixing agents to best-fit models so merge
throughput improves.

### Platform Admin

Needs policy control and visibility across many teams and projects.

User story:

As a platform admin, I want configurable global model preferences and team

## Use Cases and Core Flows

### Primary Use Cases

- Compare scorecards across supported model families.
- Assign models by team and agent type.

## How to Use This Guide

Use this guide with Forge automated mapping defaults. Keep agent-model config
files updated as team priorities change. Reassess weights quarterly.

## General Model Selection Principles (Coding)

Prioritize:

- code generation quality,
- reasoning depth,
- context support,
- latency,
- cost,
- compatibility.

Quality usually dominates, but high-throughput teams may shift weight toward
cost and latency for selected agents.

## Model Family Highlights

- Strong long-context coding performance
- Safety-oriented behavior
- Tends toward conservative or verbose outputs

### GPT (OpenAI)

- Strong baseline coding and reasoning performance
- Broad plugin and tool compatibility
- Fast family iteration can introduce drift

### Gemini (Google)

- Competitive multilingual coding support
- Good cloud ecosystem integration
- API behavior may shift across versions

### Kimi, Minimax, GLM

- Often cost-efficient in specific regions
- Useful for multilingual or regional deployments
- Watch API, compliance, and rate-limit specifics

### Grok, SWE, o3

- Useful for experimentation and open workflows
- Strong innovation pace
- Maturity and enterprise support vary

## Example Scorecard (Coding Context)

> **Note:** This scorecard provides a baseline reference. Detailed weighted scores for each team are in PRD-003.

| Model            | Code | Reasoning | Context        | Speed    | Cost | Compatibility | Notes                                                |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------- | -------------- | -------- | ---- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Opus 4.6  | 5.0  | 4.5       | 200K (1M beta) | Standard | $$$  | Native        | Conservative in speculative code                     |
| GPT-4o           | 4.8  | 4.7       | 128K           | Fast     | $$   | Full          | Strong general-purpose coding and tool-use           |
| Gemini 1.5 Pro   | 4.6  | 4.5       | 1M             | Standard | $$   | Full          | Large-context workflows; structured output improving |
| Kimi K2 Thinking | 4.2  | 4.4       | 256K           | Standard | $    | Partial       | Strong pass@1 profile; verify provider integration   |
| Grok Code Fast 1 | 4.0  | 4.2       | 131K           | Fast     | $    | Experimental  | Strong speed/cost profile; evolving ecosystem        |

**Model naming convention:** In configuration files, model names use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., "Claude Opus 4.6" → "claude-opus-4-6").

**Cost notation:**
- $ = Low cost (e.g., < $0.50 per 1M tokens)
- $$ = Medium cost (e.g., $0.50–$5 per 1M tokens)
- $$$ = High cost (e.g., > $5 per 1M tokens)

## Agent Mapping Example

```yaml
agents:
  - name: bug_fixer
    model: claude-opus-4-6
    weights:
      code_quality: 0.5
      reasoning: 0.3
      context: 0.1
      cost: 0.1
  - name: doc_generator
    model: gemini-1.5-pro
    weights:
      code_quality: 0.4
      context: 0.4
      cost: 0.1
      speed: 0.1
team_defaults:
  backend: claude-opus-4-6
  frontend: gpt-4o-mini
fallback_model: gpt-4o-mini
```

## Decision Matrix Mechanics

Forge calculates weighted scores per model and context. Defaults can be
overridden by admins per agent or team. If a model fails health checks or is
deprecated, Forge routes to the next compatible score winner.

## Migration and Switching Guidance

- Plan upgrades with canary or shadow runs.
- Track version drift against invoked runtime models.
- Define fallback policy before major migrations.
- Re-run scorecard comparisons after provider pricing changes.

## Model Lore (Team-Friendly Trivia)

- Claude references Claude Shannon.
- GPT-4o uses -o- for -omni-.
- Grok comes from science fiction and means deep understanding.

Use scorecards as guidance, then tune by team outcome data.

## Appendix: IDE Model/Capability Matrix

Many capability fields (context window, max output, tool use, vision, reliability, determinism, JSON support) remain TBD until the benchmark annex validation completes. See the Pending Benchmark Annex and timeline for when capability fields will be populated. Do not use for production routing decisions without independent verification.

### Notes

- **Cost multiplier normalization:** Free is stored as 0 in the multiplier column for arithmetic convenience.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6 promo:** represented as two rows to make the multiplier
  unambiguous (No thinking vs With thinking).
- **Minimax M2.5 promo:** set to 0.25x as per banner (overrides a preliminary 1x setting).
- Capability columns are intentionally **TBD** unless independently validated.
- If preferred, this can be collapsed to one row per base model by introducing a
  dedicated -Thinking modes & multipliers- column.

**Contingency Actions:**

- Use best-available evaluated sibling models for production routing
- Apply conservative safety margins for unvalidated models
- Hold non-critical feature rollouts until validation completes
- Reassign ownership if benchmarks miss ETAs by >2 weeks

Interpretation guidance:

- `Not evaluated` means no reproducible benchmark evidence in this repo yet.
- Prioritize independent benchmark values over vendor launch claims when ranking.
- For Cursor/Windsurf routing, treat this table as **evidence status**, not final
  score inputs, until internal replication is completed.
