## Weighting Profile

| Metric        | Weight | Rationale                          |
| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Code Quality  | 25%    | Test correctness and reliability   |
| Reasoning     | 20%    | Test strategy and edge-case design |
| Cost          | 15%    | Moderate budget sensitivity        |
| Context       | 20%    | Large suites require context depth |
| Speed         | 10%    | CI runtime and iteration speed     |
| Compatibility | 10%    | Framework and stack support        |

## Scoring Contract

- Metric scale: `0-10` where `10` is best.
- Weight sum must equal `100`.
- Base formula:

`Weighted Score = (Code*25 + Reasoning*20 + Cost*15 + Context*20 + Speed*10 + Compatibility*10) / 100`

- Optional policy penalties:
  - `lock_in_penalty`: `0.00-0.20`
  - `quirks_penalty`: `0.00-0.15`
- Final score:

`Final Score = max(0, Weighted Score - lock_in_penalty - quirks_penalty)`

## Model Rankings (Final Scores)

### Tier 1: Recommended (Score >= 8.60)

| Model              | Score | Key Strengths                   | Notes                            |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Claude Opus 4.6    | 8.80  | Strong code quality and context | Best default for test generation |
| GPT-5.3 Codex High | 8.75  | Strong coding and reasoning     | Premium option                   |
| SWE-Llama          | 8.65  | Code and test specialization    | Excellent for test-heavy work    |

### Tier 2: Strong Alternatives (Score 8.20-8.59)

| Model             | Score | Key Strengths             | Notes                     |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| GLM-5             | 8.35  | Multilingual support      | Useful for mixed stacks   |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 8.25  | Lower-cost Claude profile | Routine testing flows     |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro    | 8.20  | Large context support     | Very large suite analysis |

### Tier 3: Cost-Aware (Score 7.00-7.99)

| Model     | Score | Key Strengths | Notes                     |
| --------- | ----- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Kimi K2.5 | 7.90  | Budget option | Non-critical test tasks   |
| o3        | 7.65  | Low cost      | High-volume routine tests |

## Decision Policy

- Primary default: `Claude Opus 4.6`
- Test-specialist alternate: `SWE-Llama`
- Cost-aware alternate: `o3`

Fallback triggers:

- Provider outage or repeated 5xx: route to next highest compatible model.
- 7-day spend overrun above 15%: route routine suites to cost-aware model.
- P95 latency regression above 25%: switch to faster model in same score band.
- Deprecation notice: migrate in next release cycle with audit note.

## Newly Tracked Models (Pending Full Benchmark Scoring)

These models are now included in intake analysis but are excluded from weighted
ranking tables until benchmark metrics are validated.
