# __TEMPLATE__



## Project Context











- **Default Branch**: main


## Coding Standards

- Write minimal, focused diffs — change only what is necessary.
- Maintain backwards compatibility; document breaking changes.
- Every behavioral change must include tests.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Use environment variables.
- Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures.
- Use the strongest type safety available for the language.
















## Testing






Always run the full test suite before creating a pull request. Never disable or skip existing tests without explicit justification.



## Documentation

- **PRDs**: `docs/prd/`





- **Quality Gates**: `QUALITY_GATES.md`
- **Runbook**: `RUNBOOK_AI.md`

## Agent Teams

This project uses a multi-team orchestration model. Teams are specialized by domain:

- Start with `/orchestrate` to assess the current state and coordinate work.
- Use `/plan` to create structured implementation plans before coding.
- Run `/check` to verify quality gates (lint, test, build) before committing.
- Use `/handoff` to document session state for continuity.

See `UNIFIED_AGENT_TEAMS.md` for full team definitions and workflow phases.
See `COMMAND_GUIDE.md` for when to choose `/orchestrate`, `/plan`, `/project-review`, and other commands.
