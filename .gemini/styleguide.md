# Style Guide — __TEMPLATE__

This style guide is auto-generated from the project's rule definitions.
See `AGENTS.md` for universal project conventions.

## General Principles

- Write minimal, focused diffs — change only what is necessary.
- Maintain backwards compatibility; document breaking changes.
- Every behavioral change must include tests.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials.
- Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures.
- Use the strongest type safety available for the language.

## Quality Gates

Before marking any work complete:

1. All existing tests pass
2. New tests cover the change
3. Linter reports no new warnings
4. Build succeeds
5. No secrets in the diff
6. Documentation updated if behavior changed
