# agentkit-forge — Gemini Instructions



## Project Context











- **Default Branch**: main


## Coding Standards

- Write minimal, focused diffs — change only what is necessary.
- Maintain backwards compatibility; document breaking changes.
- Every behavioral change must include tests.
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Use environment variables.
- Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures.
- Use the strongest type safety available for the language.
















## Testing






Always run the full test suite before creating a pull request.



## Documentation

- **PRDs**: `docs/prd/`




- See `AGENTS.md` for universal agent instructions.
- See `QUALITY_GATES.md` for quality gate definitions.





## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, focus on:

1. **Correctness** — Does the code do what it claims?
2. **Security** — Are there injection, auth, or data exposure risks?
3. **Testing** — Are new behaviors covered by tests?
4. **Maintainability** — Is the code readable and well-structured?
5. **Performance** — Are there obvious performance concerns?
6. **Conventions** — Does it follow established project patterns?
